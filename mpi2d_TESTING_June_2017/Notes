Spent some time looking around for a notes -like file listing changes from Brian, and dbg as I asked on Dec. 5 and other times,
but can't seemm to find. 
Will do diffs and try to follow here what changes from Brian's Dec. 1.3 eversion. 
Would also like to know how different from the 1. 4 version we "released" in Feb. 2011.

ranget, does it use the right shifts file? 
same with framesToSelect

changed stg 1.2 to add framesToSelect and be 1:nTimes

also added into 3.12 so when it gives up, will write out default circles for endo, epi, bld, so at least pipeline will
keep going and process everything. In fact, might even skip the guess. 

Fixed up nice script for ungated. Maybe should do same for gated, plus even more - to set up the directories and links. 




sat. 8/27/11, 
wow, really sucking time!  Forgot how 4.1 and 4.2 handle things, and not sure all correct. 
Pretty much all issues with using a different AIF:
So, first I notice alignCurves not really used for adjusting bld delay (turns out it is, it shifts the bldcurve, but the value doesn't get used. )
Then another function is called and it gives a small shift.
ISSUE:  should use fb from saturated AIF (current version), or from "true" dual bolus AIF?  Makes fb values quite different.  And 4.2 expects to use dual bolus AIF, so fits look very poor. 

2. In par file, choose fixedDelay=99 if all delays estimated in each region. And choose fixedDelay=0 if it just uses single delay (estimated from aligncurves which maybe just does integer part, and then a function to give finer one for mean of all regions. )

3. To do QC and check with 4.2, hard to make sure it does what 4.1 does. Seems shifts always off. Guess could do the aligncurves again there, or could just let delay have a large range and use it..  in that case don't use aligncurves.  Or use it and add it back in at the end before writing out delays!
So do this - or if fixedDelay==0, then 

4. Getting ktrans=2.5, with using low dose scaled up by 10!  Though very small fv, like 0.  Fits look reasonable. Did we dose wrong?  This is P063011. Or some other issue?  This is series 27000  and doing systole only, so maybe AIF is missing peak from a bunch of frames?  Will have to look. 

Other issues: 
TimeStampFileAIF never used. 
Timestamps not getting ranget or skips applied to them (haven't checked numSkip), but seems just read in and applied in 4.1, and then skips applied??

Now making it to apply ranget and framesToSelect, then interp to uniform, then fit. This is done in 4.1, might be nice to move to 3.4? 

For now, left in first function of 4.1. 

"Fixed" 4.2 also to show the same AIF and curves used to fit. Delay?   Note - might have broken things for non-dual bolus, or for when low dose has more frames than the full dose. 


added flagTimeStamps in 4.2, 
and special try/catch in 4.1, so when not shifting, indices are ok..  should revisit this, at least put in good error messages. 


Instructions:
1. Have ungated or all recons in ReconData, and run stg=1.2, this creates par files.

2. Create (hard-code path and series numbers)  from template autoROI_sumP063011_latest.m  (in /v/raid1/ed/src/matlab/Testing
and run it, writes out framesToSelect in a file. 

3. Modify (again,  series/slice, and ranget) from template sys_dias_modifyParFile.m   (in /v/raid1/ed/MRIdata/Cardiac/Verio/P063011/Processing
Note - this would be pretty easy to combine 2 and 3. 
This modifies par file to add in framesToSelect, and modify ranget and seriesAIF

4. Modify Auto_all_ForDualBolus (again, first_series), template in Code_1.5_Aug2011  
Note - could call it from #3 and pass first_series. 
This runs registration and seg. etc., for all slices of the ungated series.  (could use old Auto_all which does all par files. Suggest not using 6.1 as it can hang on a keyboard)

5. For each study - Run 3.11 and modify segmentation and registration and save
		  -  Re-run 0.23, 3.2, 3.4, 4.1  to process for real.
 	     	  -  Use stage 4.2 to assess quality, especially if subtracting off reasonable frames so starts at zero.
